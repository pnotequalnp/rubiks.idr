# rubiks.idr
A library for defining, manipulating, scrambling, and solving arbitrary twisty puzzles using
graph-theoretic and group-theoretic abstractions.

## Design
Standard [twisty puzzles](https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Twisty_puzzle) can be modeled
as [groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)). With this model,
[metrics](https://www.speedsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Metric) can be represented as subsets of these
groups. A [Cayley graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley_graph) is a colored graph which can be
constructed from a group and any generating set of that group. Finding a path to the identity
element on the Cayley graph generated by a twisty puzzle and a metric corresponds to solving that
puzzle, with the color of the edges in the path corresponding to the solution.

### Graphs
`Data.Graph` provides an interface representing a colored graph as a function from a node to its
neighbors along with the color of the edge traversed. It also provides generic algorithms for
searching graphs. [Depth-first search (DFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search) and
[iterative deepening depth-first search
(IDS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_deepening_depth-first_search) both take an optional
argument to prune the search tree by providing a lower bounding function. When provided a lower
bound, IDS becomes [Iterative deepening A*
(IDA*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_deepening_A*).

`Data.Graph.Cayley` provides a generic implementation of the Cayley graph for a group and a
generating set.

### Groups
`Data.Group` provides a group interface and an interface for representing generating sets, along
with many generic or trivial implementations of both.

`Data.Group.Permutation` provides an interface for permutation groups, along with two concrete
representations: a list of cycles, and a permutation vector.

`Data.Group.Cyclic` provides an implementation of cyclic groups.
